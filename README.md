### The result of execution of the code above:
```
Result of comparison (lhs == 5) < (rhs == 7) is True
Result of comparison (lhs == 5) < (rhs == 3) is False
Result of comparison (lhs == 5) < (rhs == 5) is False
Upper bound for value 5 is 7
Result of comparison (lhs == 7) < (rhs == 5) is False
Result of comparison (lhs == 3) < (rhs == 5) is True
Result of comparison (lhs == 5) < (rhs == 5) is False
```

- Note, that for retuned upper bound comparator returnes `True`.
